## Idea of the project

When using 3D printers, failures are inevitable. One of the most common types of failure occurs when the printed object detaches from the bed, resulting in a mess of stringy filament caused by the printer extruding into mid-air â€” commonly referred to as **spaghetti**. 

This unexpected behavior can lead to issues such as filament blobs forming on the hotend, potentially causing damage, as well as wasting filament and printing time. 

The goal of this project is to use **machine vision** to detect these failures early and stop the printing process before any serious damage occurs, ultimately saving both **filament** and **time**.
